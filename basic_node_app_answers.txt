1. What is a Node module?
  A node module is a set of functions that can be used in your application. It is similiar to using a JavaScript library.

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?
  exports is a reference to module.exports, but it cannot reassign module.exports. module.exports is an empty object and can be reassigned to anything.

3. Why is using exports recommended?
  Using exports is recommended unless you are planning on having your module be a specific object type, because exports is not returned by require() and
  changing it's properties will not alter what we are returning.
